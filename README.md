general information about rat

Joshua 'rat' Lynch was born 30th October 20XX in Gosford, Australia. Having moved several times throughout his early childhood he found it difficult to make friends and was, generally speaking, socially awkward. Having finally settled down in his hometown by 2012, rat developed a great deal of interest in a few activies primarily dance and video games.

Having experienced everything, what he believed, dancing had to offer he retired completely in 2016 to focus on academics and video games such as Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and League of Legends.

He sucks at all of them. 

He plays them anyway.

rat is currently an active member in the SteamLadder discord where he regularly converses with other members. He sits at a 'good' reputation status on their website and appears to be well-liked by his peers. Furthermore, he is currently sitting comfortable above level 100 on Steam and intends to continue to climb. 

As of right now, rat is studying a Bachelor of Computer Science and Mathematics at Charles Sturt University and is hoping to graduate into security or programming.

He supremely sucks at programming but practise makes perfect.
